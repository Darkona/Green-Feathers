# Configuration

Green Feathers has three config files in `config/feathers/`:

| File | Kind | What's in it |
|---|---|---|
| `Feathers-Server.toml` | Server | Feathers, regeneration, strain, exhaustion, effects, resting, armor weights, basic exertion, mounts |
| `Feathers-Compat.toml` | Server | One section per supported mod, each with its own switch |
| `Feathers-Client.toml` | Client | The HUD: position, feather color, animations, tooltips |

Server configs belong to the server: it sends its own to every player who joins, so everyone plays by the same rules whatever their own files say. Modpacks ship their defaults in `defaultconfigs/`. The client config is each player's own.

Changes to the server configs apply while the game runs.

## Commands

Operators (permission level 2) can inspect and adjust feathers:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/feathers info <targets>` | Shows their feathers, strain, weight and state |
| `/feathers set <targets> <amount>` | Sets their feathers; above zero it also clears their strain |
| `/feathers reset <targets>` | Full feathers, no strain, not exhausted |
| `/feathers max <targets> <amount>` | Sets their base maximum feathers (kept across rejoins and deaths, like any attribute base) |
| `/feathers regen <targets> <amount>` | Sets their base regeneration, in feathers per second (kept across rejoins and deaths) |
| `/feathers spend <targets> <amount>` | Spends feathers as if an action had |
| `/feathers debug <targets> [seconds]` | Lists what spent their feathers recently, by source |

Targets can be mounts too.
